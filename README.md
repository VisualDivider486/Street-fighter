# Street-fighter-like-game

This is a game similar to the well known "Street Fighter" game .I wrote it on my third semester at college using the sgg library.The project overall helped me get familiar with basic concepts of the C++ language and practice them through coding

The game includes of 2 fighters with attack and defend commands as described in command keys.txt,a health bar for both players and a countdown
The executable file is in bin file named "Game.exe"
